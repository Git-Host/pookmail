# POOKMAIL #


[PookMail.com](http://www.pookmail.com) was a disposable email accounts System developed in the middle of 2004.

Our main goal was to give a place where people could receive emails without any kind of register nor signup. Usually people used PookMail to receive their confirmation emails.

But unfortunately [in the middle of 2008 we had to close PookMail.com](http://pookmail.blogspot.com/2008/08/who-wants-to-live-forever.html).

We think the best tribute we can pay to [PookMail.com](http://www.pookmail.com) is to release its source code to the Community.

So, if you want to have your own Disponsable Email Account System, go on! Download and install it!
